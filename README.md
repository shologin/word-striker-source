# CS50 WORD STRIKER GAME

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/XCSScqtG6qI

#### Description:

This game was developed as a final project for the CS50 course. In this game, you will be typing words in order to strike falling bubbles.

Objective: to get as many scores as you can.

For each 100 points, the extra bonus opens. Hit the SPACE button to freeze the game field and get an advantage.

Along with the scores, the game provides a measurement of your accuracy. You can see your accuracy at the end of each game.

The highest scores are kept in records, so you can track your progress.

Word Striker will improve your typing skills. The game is intended to refine the player's typing skills and reactions in an easy and entertaining way.

<b>Features:</b>

The game was developed on pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the use of OOP techniques. If you look at the source code, you will see a bunch of classes that are interwoven in the main.js file.

To bundle scripts and CSS files together and minimize the script, I'm using Gulp.

Here you can find the main features of the Word Striker:

- Lightweight browser game.

- Score tracking and high score recording

- Typing accuracy measurement

- Extra bonuses, such as freezing the game field

- Straightforward source code

- Developed in HTML canvas.

What's more, there is a large room for improvement. All classes and features are independent; therefore, it is easy to expand the game by adding new features such as new extra bonuses, changing the speed of bubbles, etc.

It is possible to even connect a backend party to the database, so users will have the ability to sign up and compare their high records with others.

<b>Challenges.</b>

There were two main challenges with this project. Firstly, I had to find out HOW to work with HTML canvas. Despite having already had some practice in web development, the canvas element was new to me. Therefore, equipped with the knowledge of "how to learn," I delved into this "rabbit hole," and it was much deeper than it seemed at first glance.

Then, armed with new information, I started to type my code. It wasn't as challenging as it was invigorating. I became more familiar with OOP, ES6 classes, and the general idea of game creation.

The second challenge was when I faced a problem: I needed to find out the angle between the bubble and the X-axis of a screen so the projectile could fly properly. What's more, I needed some algorithm that tells EVERY projectile how it should be rotated and to which target it must fly.

To solve this one, I got down to the old "friend" trygonometry. Being a person who last heard this word back in 10 years, it was a problematic topic for me.

However, as soon as enough effort has been put in, I get the hang of it. I find out that sinuses and cosinuses are really wonderful tools to automatically track the angle between gunpoint and a target.

Looking back on this project, I can summarize that it was a marvelous experience. When you put in enough effort, you can learn and achieve anything.

Here is a list of additional libraries and services that I leveraged to enhance design solutions:

- Animated CSS background generator https://wweb.dev/resources/animated-css-background-generator

- Generate amazing glassmorphism effects for some blocks https://css.glass/

- Bundle .js and .css files and minimize JS https://gulpjs.com/

A lot of knowledge I gathered on the field of the YouTube.

Finally, I want to adress the whole bunch of appreciation to thee whole CS50 course, that share COPIOUS amounts of knowledge.
